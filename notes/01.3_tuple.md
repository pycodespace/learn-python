Certainly! Tuples in Python, being immutable sequences, have a set of built-in functions (methods) and operations available. Here are some commonly used ones with examples:

### Built-in Functions for Tuples

1. **`len()`**: Returns the number of items in the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 'three', 4.5)
   print(len(my_tuple))  # Output: 4
   ```

2. **`count()`**: Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in the tuple.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 'three', 2, 4.5)
   print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 3 (2 occurs three times)
   ```

3. **`index()`**: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in the tuple. Raises a `ValueError` if the value is not found.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 'three', 4.5, 2)
   print(my_tuple.index(2))  # Output: 1 (index of the first occurrence of 2)
   ```

4. **Tuple unpacking**: Assigning tuple elements to multiple variables in a single statement.

   ```python
   my_tuple = ('John', 'Doe', 30)
   first_name, last_name, age = my_tuple
   print(first_name)  # Output: 'John'
   print(last_name)   # Output: 'Doe'
   print(age)         # Output: 30
   ```

5. **`sorted()`**: Returns a new sorted list from the elements of the tuple (not an in-place operation).

   ```python
   my_tuple = (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5)
   sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted(my_tuple))
   print(sorted_tuple)  # Output: (1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9)
   ```

6. **`min()` and `max()`**: Returns the smallest and largest element in the tuple, respectively.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5)
   print(min(my_tuple))  # Output: 1
   print(max(my_tuple))  # Output: 9
   ```

These functions and operations make tuples quite versatile for storing immutable sequences of elements in Python.
