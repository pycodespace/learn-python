## Sets
Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. They support various built-in functions (methods) that allow you to manipulate and perform operations on sets efficiently. Here are some commonly used built-in functions for sets along with examples:

### Built-in Functions for Sets

1. **`len()`**: Returns the number of elements in the set.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   print(len(my_set))  # Output: 5
   ```

2. **`add()`**: Adds an element to the set. If the element is already present, the set remains unchanged.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   my_set.add(4)
   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
   ```

3. **`remove()`**: Removes a specified element from the set. Raises a `KeyError` if the element is not found.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   my_set.remove(2)
   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3}
   ```

4. **`discard()`**: Removes a specified element from the set if it is present. If the element is not present, the set remains unchanged.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   my_set.discard(2)
   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3}
   ```

5. **`pop()`**: Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises a `KeyError` if the set is empty.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   popped_element = my_set.pop()
   print(popped_element)  # Output: an arbitrary element, e.g., 1
   print(my_set)          # Output: {2, 3, 4, 5} (element 1 is removed)
   ```

6. **`clear()`**: Removes all elements from the set.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   my_set.clear()
   print(my_set)  # Output: set()
   ```

7. **`copy()`**: Returns a shallow copy of the set.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   new_set = my_set.copy()
   print(new_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
   ```

8. **`union()`**: Returns a new set with elements from the set and all specified sets.

   ```python
   set1 = {1, 2, 3}
   set2 = {3, 4, 5}
   union_set = set1.union(set2)
   print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   ```

9. **`intersection()`**: Returns a new set with elements that are common to the set and all specified sets.

   ```python
   set1 = {1, 2, 3}
   set2 = {2, 3, 4}
   intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
   print(intersection_set)  # Output: {2, 3}
   ```

10. **`difference()`**: Returns a new set with elements in the set that are not in the specified sets.

    ```python
    set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    set2 = {3, 4, 5}
    difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
    print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}
    ```

11. **`symmetric_difference()`**: Returns a new set with elements that are in either of the sets, but not both.

    ```python
    set1 = {1, 2, 3}
    set2 = {3, 4, 5}
    symmetric_difference_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
    print(symmetric_difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
    ```

12. **`issubset()`** and **`issuperset()`**: Checks whether another set contains this set (`issubset()`) or whether this set contains another set (`issuperset()`).

    ```python
    set1 = {1, 2}
    set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    print(set1.issubset(set2))  # Output: True
    print(set2.issuperset(set1))  # Output: True
    ```

13. **`isdisjoint()`**: Checks whether two sets have no elements in common.

    ```python
    set1 = {1, 2, 3}
    set2 = {4, 5, 6}
    print(set1.isdisjoint(set2))  # Output: True
    ```

These methods provide powerful ways to manipulate and perform operations on sets in Python, making them efficient for handling collections of unique elements.


## frozenset

`frozenset` is an immutable version of the `set` data type in Python. Being immutable, `frozenset` objects do not support certain operations that modify its contents after creation. Here are the available built-in functions (methods) for `frozenset` objects:



### Built-in Functions for `frozenset`

1. **`frozenset()`**: Constructor that creates a new `frozenset` object from an iterable (like a list or a set).

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}
   frozen_set = frozenset(my_set)
   print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   ```

2. **`copy()`**: Returns a shallow copy of the `frozenset`.

   ```python
   frozen_set = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   new_set = frozen_set.copy()
   print(new_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   ```

3. **`difference()`**: Returns the difference between two or more `frozensets` as a new `frozenset`.

   ```python
   set1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   set2 = frozenset({3, 4, 5})
   diff_set = set1.difference(set2)
   print(diff_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2})
   ```

4. **`intersection()`**: Returns the intersection of two or more `frozensets` as a new `frozenset`.

   ```python
   set1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   set2 = frozenset({3, 4, 5})
   intersect_set = set1.intersection(set2)
   print(intersect_set)  # Output: frozenset({3})
   ```

5. **`union()`**: Returns the union of two or more `frozensets` as a new `frozenset`.

   ```python
   set1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   set2 = frozenset({3, 4, 5})
   union_set = set1.union(set2)
   print(union_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
   ```

6. **`isdisjoint()`**: Checks if the `frozenset` has no elements in common with another `frozenset`.

   ```python
   set1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   set2 = frozenset({4, 5, 6})
   print(set1.isdisjoint(set2))  # Output: True (no common elements)
   ```

7. **`issubset()`**: Checks if every element in the `frozenset` is present in another `frozenset`.

   ```python
   set1 = frozenset({1, 2})
   set2 = frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})
   print(set1.issubset(set2))  # Output: True (set1 is a subset of set2)
   ```

8. **`issuperset()`**: Checks if every element in another `frozenset` is present in the `frozenset`.

   ```python
   set1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})
   set2 = frozenset({1, 2})
   print(set1.issuperset(set2))  # Output: True (set1 is a superset of set2)
   ```

9. **`symmetric_difference()`**: Returns the symmetric difference between two `frozensets` as a new `frozenset`.

   ```python
   set1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
   set2 = frozenset({3, 4, 5})
   sym_diff_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
   print(sym_diff_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 4, 5})
   ```

10. **`intersection_update()`**, **`difference_update()`**, **`symmetric_difference_update()`**: These methods update the `frozenset` in place with the respective operation.

    ```python
    set1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3})
    set2 = frozenset({3, 4, 5})
    set1.intersection_update(set2)
    print(set1)  # Output: frozenset({3})
    ```

These methods allow you to perform various set operations on `frozenset` objects, which are useful for scenarios where immutability and hashability are desired, such as using `frozenset` as keys in dictionaries or elements in other sets.
